# Introduction



# Defining the API

Before we begin implementation, we need to decide what we want the end result to _look like_.

What will the experience of authoring tests be like for developers?

## Conventional Testing Styles

Developers who have experience authoring tests will likely have used one or more _testing styles_.

There are different schools of thought on what tests should _look like_.

#### xUnit, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Gherkin

The most common testing _syntax styles_ are: [xUnit][], [Behavior-Driven Development][BDD], and [Gherkin][].

> Note: Behavior-Driven Development is a software _process_, not a code syntax.  
> However, similar _syntax styles_ have emerged over the years for these different testing paradigms.

### xUnit

xUnit-style syntax typically...

- Uses built-in language constructs for defining "Test Fixtures" (_groups of tests_) and "Tests"
- Provides `setUp` and `tearDown` functions for test setup and cleanup.
- Uses "Assertions" implemented as functions accepting 2 parameters: "Expected" and "Actual"

```cs
class DogTests {
	Dog dog;
	setUp() { dog = new Dog(); }
	testBark() {  
		assertEqual("Woof!", dog.Bark());
	}
}
```

### Behavior-Driven Development

BDD-style syntax typically...

- Places an emphasis on using natural language, e.g. `describe("Dog").it("can bark!")`
- Provides `before` and `after` functions for test setup and cleanup.
- Uses natural language for "Expectations", e.g. `x.ShouldEqual()` or `Expect(x).toEqual()`

```cs
Dog dog;
describe("Dog", () => {
  before() { dog = new Dog(); }
  it("can bark", () => {
    expect(dog.Bark()).toEqual("Woof!");
  });
});
```

### Gherkin (aka Cucumber)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)#Gherkin_language):

> "Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD)."
>
> "Gherkin is the language that Cucumber uses to define test cases."

Gherkin is another BDD testing syntax which places an emphasis on using natural language.

Rather than defining tests in programming code, Gherkin uses a plain text syntax:

```gherkin
Feature: Dog
  Scenario: Barking
    Given a dog
    When the dog barks
    Then the output should be "Woof!"
```

Testing libraries for Gherkin allow you to write an interpreter for your Gherkin code:

```cs
[Then("the output should be \"(.*)\"")]
public void ThenTheOutputShouldBe(string value) {
  Output.Should().Equal(value);
}
```

## Choosing a Style to Implement

So, which style(s) should we support with our MiniSpec testing framework project?

You can implement whatever you like! Whatever syntax your heart desires `<3`

In this book, we will be implementing:

- xUnit syntax where each test is represented by a C# method and uses assertions
- BDD syntax where each test is defined using a lambda and uses expectations
- We will embrace the [top-level statement support][TLS] in C# 9 ( _just for fun!_ )

#### Why Multiple Syntaxes?

Let's make it flexible so that users can pick and choose! It's fun. Design goals below:

### xUnit Syntax

```cs
using static MiniSpec.Assert;

void SetUp() { /* do something */ }
void TearDown() { /* do something */ }
void TestSomething() {
  AssertEquals(42, TheAnswer);
}
```

### BDD Syntax

```cs
using static MiniSpec.Expect;

MiniSpec.Describe((spec) => {
  spec.Before(() => { /* do something */ });
  spec.After(() => { /* do something */ });
  spec.It("does something", () => {
    Expect(TheAnswer).ToEqual(42);
  });
});
```

# Test-Driven Test Development

We will test-drive the development of our testing framework (_test-driven test development!_)

As we're using [Test-Driven Development][TDD] (TDD), the first thing we need is a _failing test_!

## Writing a Red Test

We will be using Behavior-Driven Development, so we'll start off by testing some behavior.

### Project Setup

Create an project folder somewhere. This is where you'll be writing the test framework.

```sh
mkdir MiniSpec
cd MiniSpec
```

> Consider making the folder a git repository to save changes as you walk thru this book:
> ```sh 
> git init
> ```

Let's create a test project and write tests _pretending_ that MiniSpec already works:

```sh
dotnet new console -n MyTests
```

> _A new `console` projects? Wait. What? Why in the... what? So: only console projects support_  
> _the new top-level statements in C# 9, so let's define tests in a console project! This will_  
> _be an optional feature and, well, it's just neato and I'd like to try it out! Let's have fun._

This will create a new project folder `MyTests/`. Let's go there and write our first test!

We'll create a file containing 2 xUnit-style tests, one which should fail and the other should pass.

Rename the generated `Program.cs` file to `Tests.cs` and replace its content with the following:

### Example `Tests.cs` File

```cs
void TestShouldPass() {
  // Do nothing
}

void TestShouldFail() {
  throw new System.Exception("Kaboom!");
}
```

That's it. No `using` statements. Just a tiny file with 2 methods. They're not even `public`.

Now, we have two options:

- Write **implementation code** to _run these two tests_ and **print** out the results
- Write **integration test** which _runs these two tests_ and verifies the results are **printed** correctly.

Either approach is valid. We can treat our new `Tests.cs` _as a failing test_, conceptually.

But let's go ahead and setup a real integration test which we can add to during development!

### Integration Tests

Back in the root of our project folder, let's create a project using an _existing_ .NET testing framework.

At the time of writing, there are a many choices to choose from: `xUnit`, `NUnit`, `MSTest`, and more.

To make this tutorial easier for most developers out there, let's use the most popular one: `xUnit`

Let's make a new `xUnit` test project now by running this command from the _root project folder_:

```sh
dotnet new xunit -n MiniSpec.Specs
```

This will create a new project folder `MiniSpec.Specs/`. Let's go there and write an integration test!

We'll create a test which:

- Runs `minispec.exe` with the `MyTests.dll` DLL assembly provided as an argument
- Asserts that the output contains text which indicates that `TestShouldPass()` passed
- Asserts that the output contains text which indicates that `TestShouldFail()` failed

> What is `minispec.exe`? It doesn't exist yet, but that's the program we'll make to run tests!



Rename `UnitTest1.cs` to `IntegrationTest.cs` and replace its content with the following:

#### `IntegrationTest.cs`

```cs
using Xunit;

public class IntegrationTest {

    [Fact]
    public void ExpectedSpecsPassAndFail() {
        // Arrange
        var minispecExe = System.IO.File.Exists("minispec.exe") ?
            "minispec.exe" : "minispec"; // No .exe extension on Linux
            
        using var minispec = new System.Diagnostics.Process {
            StartInfo = {
                RedirectStandardOutput = true, // Get the STDOUT
                RedirectStandardError = true,  // Get the STDERR
                FileName = minispecExe,
                Arguments = "MyTests.dll"
            }
        };

        // Act
        minispec.Start();
        minispec.WaitForExit();
        var stdout = minispec.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
        var stderr = minispec.StandardError.ReadToEnd();
        var output = $"{stdout}{stderr}";
        minispec.Kill();

        // Assert
        Assert.Contains("PASS TestShouldPass", output);
        Assert.Contains("FAIL TestShouldFail", output);
        Assert.Contains("Kaboom!", output);
    }
}
```



#### Review

So, what's happening here?

- We assume that there will be a `minispec.exe` executable (_or simply `minispec` on Linux_).
- We invoke the `minispec.exe` process passing the DLL with our defined tests as an argument.
- We read STDOUT and STDERR from the process result, i.e. all of the program's console output.
- _STDOUT and STDERR are combined because we don't currently care which the results output to._
- We look for expected messages in the output, e.g. `PASS [testname]` or `FAIL [testname]`


> We're totally making up some of these things as we go along, e.g. the `PASS`/`FAIL` messages.  
> This is how TDD works. We just need to make it fail, then pass, then we can change it later!

## Making it Go Green

Our goal now is to make the test pass.

Is our goal to fully implement the testing framework? **No.**

Using TDD our goal now is _simply_ to do whatever we need to do to make the test pass.

### MiniSpec Project

Back in the root of our project folder, let's create a new project for `minispec.exe`.

Let's make a new `console` project by running this command from the _root project folder_:

```sh
dotnet new console -n MiniSpec
```

#### MiniSpec Solution

While we're here in the root project folder, let's create a Solution to make building simpler.

We'll add all of projects which we've created so far: `MyTests`, `MiniSpec.Specs`, and `MiniSpec`

```sh
dotnet new sln
dotnet sln add MyTests
dotnet sln add MiniSpec.Specs
dotnet sln add MiniSpec
```

If you'd ever like to build all projects at once, now you can run `dotnet build` from this folder.

### `minispec.exe`

Build the new `MiniSpec` console project by running `dotnet build` from the `MiniSpec` folder.

If you look in the generated `bin/Debug/*/` folder, you should now see a `MiniSpec.exe` file.

We'd like to make one _minor correction_ now and rename the generated executable to `minispec.exe`

We can do this by specifying `<AssemblyName>minispec</AssemblyName>` in the `.csproj` file.

Update `MiniSpec.csproj` to the following:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Rebuild the project with `dotnet build` and you will see `minispec.exe` in `bin/Debug/*/`

Great! That's the filename we specified in `IntegrationTest.cs`. Let's try running that now!


### Run the Integration Test

Back in the `MiniSpec.Specs` project, add project references for `MiniSpec` and `MyTests`:

```
cd MiniSpec.Specs/
dotnet add reference ../MiniSpec
dotnet add reference ../MyTests
```

Now run the tests with `dotnet test` (_excerpt below_)

```
IntegrationTest.ExpectedSpecsPassAndFail [FAIL]
  Failed IntegrationTest.ExpectedSpecsPassAndFail]
  Error Message:
   Assert.Contains() Failure
Not found: PASS TestShouldPass   <---- What We Expected
In value:  Hello World!          <---- Actual Value
  Stack Trace:
     at IntegrationTest.ExpectedSpecsPassAndFail()
Failed!  - Failed:     1, Passed:     0, Skipped:     0, Total:     1
```

Ah ha! The test looked for `"PASS TestShouldPass"` but found `"Hello World!"`

This is fabulous, it means that `minispec.exe` is running correctly!

Take a look at the generated `Program.cs` in the new `MiniSpec` project:

```cs
using System;

namespace MiniSpec
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

This is where the `"Hello World!"` value is coming from.

#### Update MiniSpec `Program.cs`

Try updating `MiniSpec/Program.cs` to the following:

```cs
using System;

Console.WriteLine($"Received Args: {string.Join(", ", args)}");
```

> Where's the `Main` method?  
> C# 9 supports top-level statements _used in one file_ to define your main program more easily.

And now, still from `MiniSpec.Specs/`, run `dotnet test` again to see the change:

```
$ dotnet test
...
Not found: PASS TestShouldPass
In value:  Received Args: MyTests.dll
...
```

Wonderful. Ok. Our program runs. It gets a list of DLLs. Now let's run the tests in the DLLs!

### Running Tests in DLLs

Our `minispec.exe` program is currently seeing a list of paths to DLL files.

Let's load the provided DLLs and find our defined test methods inside of them!

#### Get List of Methods in DLL

First, let's update the test to _print out a list of methods_ from the provided DLL.

Update `MiniSpec/Program.cs` to the following:

```cs
using System;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Runtime.Loader;

foreach (var dll in args) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Loading {dll}");
    var dllPath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(dll);
    var assembly = AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath(dllPath);

    foreach (var type in assembly.GetTypes()) {
        Console.WriteLine($"Found type: {type}");
        foreach (var method in type.GetMethods(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance))
            Console.WriteLine($"Instance Method: {method.Name}");
        foreach (var method in type.GetMethods(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static))
            Console.WriteLine($"Static Method: {method.Name}");
    }
}
```

##### Review

- Load any argument as a .NET DLL assembly
- Loop over every defined type in the assembly (_`args` is available to top-level statements_)
- Loop over every instance method on the type (_and print out the method name_)
- Loop over every static method on the type (_and print out the method name_)



Run the tests again with `dotnet test` (_excerpt below_)

```
Not found: PASS TestShouldPass
In value:  Loading MyTests.dll
Found type: <Program>$
Instance Method: MemberwiseClone
Instance Method: Finalize
Static Method: <Main>$
Static Method: <<Main>$>g__TestShouldPass|0_0
Static Method: <<Main>$>g__TestShouldFail|0_1
```

The test is still failing (_"Not found: PASS TestShouldPass"_) but we can see new output, which is good!

Even though we did not _explicitly_ define it, C# 9 added a `<Program>` class for us.

As you would expect from a console application, this class has a static `<Main>` method.

And it looks like we found the test methods which we defined as top-level statements too!

> Huh. `<<Main>$>g__TestShouldPass|0_0`. I guess _that's_ how local methods are represented.

#### What Now?

Well, remember our goal? _"do whatever we need to do to make the test pass"_

Let's be naive and simply run every static method we find with `Test` in the name.

Update `MiniSpec/Program.cs` to the following:

```cs
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Runtime.Loader;

foreach (var dll in args) {
    var dllPath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(dll);
    var assembly = AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath(dllPath);
    foreach (var type in assembly.GetTypes()) {
        var testMethods = type.GetMethods(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static)
            .Where(m => m.Name.Contains("Test"));
        foreach (var method in testMethods) {
            try {
                method.Invoke(null, null);
                Console.WriteLine($"PASS {method.Name}");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                Console.WriteLine($"FAIL {method.Name}");
                Console.WriteLine($"ERROR {e.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the tests again with `dotnet test` (_excerpt below_)

```
Not found: PASS TestShouldPass
In value:  PASS <<Main>$>g__TestShouldPass|0_0
FAIL <<Main>$>g__TestShouldFail|0_1
ERROR Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.
```

Yikes, we tried but a few things are incorrect which we need to fix.

- Name of the test is showing up as `<<Main>$>g__TestShouldPass|0_0`
- ^--- this should be: `TestShouldPass`
- Exception message only says _Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation_
- ^--- this should be `Kaboom!`

#### Fix `Program.cs`

Update `MiniSpec/Program.cs` to the following:

```cs
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Runtime.Loader;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

foreach (var dll in args) {
    var dllPath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(dll);
    var assembly = AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath(dllPath);
    foreach (var type in assembly.GetTypes()) {
        var testMethods = type.GetMethods(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static)
            .Where(m => m.Name.Contains("Test"));
        foreach (var method in testMethods) {
            var displayName = method.Name;
            if (Regex.IsMatch(displayName, @"[^\w]"))
                displayName =
                    Regex.Match(displayName, @"Test([\w]+)").Value;
            try {
                method.Invoke(null, null);
                Console.WriteLine($"PASS {displayName}");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                Console.WriteLine($"FAIL {displayName}");
                Console.WriteLine($"ERROR {e.InnerException.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run the tests again with `dotnet test` (_excerpt below_)

```
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:     1, Skipped:     0, Total:     1
```

*Phew!* We did it! Green, passing tests! Goodness gracious! Hooray!

Try it yourself!

```
bin/Debug/*/minispec.exe bin/Debug/*/MyTests.dll
PASS TestShouldPass
FAIL TestShouldFail
ERROR Kaboom!
```

> On Linux: `./bin/Debug/*/minispec bin/Debug/*/MyTests.dll`

## Red, Green, Refactor

If you wrote code different from what we have at home, _now is the time to Refactor!_

As the author, I am doing BDD (Book-Driven Development) and refactoring as I go.

At home, _it is really important not to forget the Refactor step!_

In the next section, we'll come up with a list of features to implement and walk thru them.

# Planning Phase

We've created a working prototype. Now we need to decide what to make next!

If you'd like, you can keep writing failing tests and then making them green.

But we're going to pause to plan a bit here.

## Features to Implement

What do we want our wonderful new test framework to provide?

> This is _my personal braindump of ideas_ - come up with your own ideas at home!

#### Command-Line Interface

- `[ ]` `minispec --version` - _Print out the current version of minispec_
- `[ ]` `minispec -l/--list` - _Print out test names instead of running them_
- `[ ]` `minispec -f/--filter [Test Name Matcher]` - _Run a subset of the tests_
- `[ ]` `minispec -v/--verbose` - _Print output from every test, even passing ones_
- `[ ]` `minispec -q/--quiet` - _Don't print anything, exit 0 on success or exit 1 on failure_
- `[ ]` `minispec` should always exit `0` on success or non-zero on failure

#### Syntax DSL ([Domain-Specific Language][DSL])

- `[ ]` Support running instance methods

#### xUnit Test Syntax DSL

- `[ ]` Detect and run `SetUp` methods before _each run_ of a test case
- `[ ]` Detect and run `TearDown` methods after _each run_ of a test case (_even if it fails_)
- `[ ]` Provide an attribute, e.g. `MiniSpec.TestData`, to support [parameterized tests][DDT] (DDT)

#### BDD Test Syntax DSL
