# MiniSpec

_Mini Testing Framework for .NET_

---

<i class="fad fa-terminal"></i> `dotnet tool install MiniSpec (Pending)`

**MiniSpec** <strike>is</strike> <u>will be</u> _both_ a mini **test framework** _and_ a mini **book** on how it was authored!

### Why?

1. After returning to C# after many years away, I was dissatisfied with the latest tools.
2. I _love_ authoring test frameworks and want to share a tutorial on doing it yourself.

> Please do not author your own testing framework unless there's a good reason.  
> This is meant to be a fun learning exercise, use conventional tools instead.
