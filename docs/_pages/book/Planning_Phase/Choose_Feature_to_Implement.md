## Choose Feature to Implement

Looking at the list, as it is now, it looks pretty daunting.

For the next parts of this book, you'll be able to hop around and implement
whichever set of these features that you'd like to
(_although some may depend on completing other sections first_).

My recommendation to you is to start by choosing one of these options:

- Something which will make you **_happy_**
- Something which is **_easy_** to get done
- Something which provides the most **_value_**

Make _sure_ that you _test-drive_ (_and don't forget the Refactor step!_).

**Have fun!**
