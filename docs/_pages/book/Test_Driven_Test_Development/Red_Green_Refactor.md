## Red, Green, Refactor

If you wrote code different from what we have at home, _now is the time to Refactor!_

As the author, I am doing BDD (Book-Driven Development) and refactoring as I go.

At home, _it is really important not to forget the Refactor step!_

In the next section, we'll come up with a list of features to implement and walk thru them.
